# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) puzzles, written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).

My main goal is not to create the quickest / shortest / fastest solution ever, but to create nice, idiomatic, readable and maintainable Rust code with suitable performance.
